                <p>Freelancing is an exciting and growing career path that is gaining more and more popularity in
                    Bangladesh. The term means lending your talents, skills ‚Äçand time in exchange for a payment. It is a
                    work environment where you are your boss; you work as much or as little as you like, and you work
                    from
                    where you feel comfortable. But it is not all coffee and cakes, especially for freelancers living in

            <h4 class="spancolor">Target set for present</h4>
            <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                CSS
                and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                directly.
                The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                the
                front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how
                the
                field is developing.</p>

                website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by
